# Generate Personalized Connectomes
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the code for conducting analyses described in the manuscript entitled "Deep generation of personalized connectomes based on individual attributes".
A conditional variational autoencoder is trained to generate individual connectomes from 194 personal measures, using the UK Biobank data.
